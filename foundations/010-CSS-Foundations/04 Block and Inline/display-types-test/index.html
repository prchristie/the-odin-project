        <h2>Block</h2>
        <p class="block">
          This is a block level element. It will be on a new line. Its width
          should be that of its parent <strong>content</strong>. The parent
          element here has padding, so it fill up its entire content
        </p>
        <p class="block">Even if the content is too small, its still wide</p>
        <p class="block">
          The paragraph here is a block! But
          <span class="inline">this is an inline element here</span>. It doesn't
          change anything (other than the colour), because inline just chills
          inline.
        </p>
        <p class="block">
          In this one, we will see that the inline element
          <span class="inline phat-padding-and-margin"
            >has some padding and margin.</span
          >This is respected in the inline direction (horizontal), but not the
          block direction (vertical).
        </p>
        <p class="block">
          We could fix this "problem" and make everything respect us by changing
          our inline element to be
          <span class="inline-block">an inline block</span>. There is no padding
          here, but this is a block element that is also inline
        </p>
        <p class="block">
          Now lets see what happens when we put some
          <span class="inline-block phat-padding-and-margin"
            >margin and padding.</span
          >. Oh shit, we got some respect, exactly like a block element would
          expect. Das pretty cool. But we don't force a new line. Except we kind
          of have?
